# website-portfolio-react
This is a new version of my personal website portfolio created for Front-End practice and to contain my personal information, skills and projects. I have decided to rewrite it using a React.js library for a modern, component based approach.

# Reflection
I have decided to rewrite my original WebsitePortfolio project which was based on basic HTML+CSS+JS and use newly learned React.js to both practice my skills and overall improve the website.

First version of the project was very hard to read because all HTML was in the same file which resulted in a lot of code and hard time finding the exact bit of code that I wanted to work on. React.js allowed to divide this project into multiple components that made it very easy to create a readable project with seperate files for all components and functionalities.

Main challenge that I have faced was to rewrite JavaScript functions to use great functionalities that React offers such as useState for dynamic changes to components. Also, I have struggled quite a bit in order to implement language change using react-polyglot as I needed to learn it from scratch and do proper research how to use it together with json files. This was especially difficult for Projects section because I have used one component to render three different projects depending on user selection and each project has two languages.

In addition to standard React, I have used ContextAPI for state management, react-polyglot + json files for language changes, sanitize-html to sanitize html with span elements and font awesome for many icons around the website.
